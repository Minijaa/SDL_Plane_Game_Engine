# SDL_Plane_Game_Engine
Project for C++ University course.

The task was to create a 2D game engine in C++ utilizing the SDL library, and an implementation demonstrating the capabilities of the engine.

Examples of functionallity:
* Collision detection on pixel-level using bitmanipulation
* Gravity and some physics capabilities (objects can bounce of each other with different elasticity)
* Sprites can be animated and moveable
* Can handle music and sounds.
* Implementer can define framerate.
* Can handle levels
* Can handle short commands using member function pointers.
* Can handle short commands using function pointers.
* Can handle text input from user
etc.
